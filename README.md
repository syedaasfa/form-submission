Project Description:
The goal of this project is to design and implement a user-friendly registration form for a website. The form includes several fields that are essential for collecting user data, such as full name, email address, phone number, and password. It is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive layout and Font Awesome icons for an aesthetically pleasing appearance.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structures the web form and defines its content.

CSS: Provides styling to make the form visually appealing. Custom styles are written to enhance Bootstrapâ€™s default styles.

JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the form by handling client-side validation and the show/hide password functionality.

Bootstrap 4.5.2: Used for the responsive layout design and to incorporate responsive form controls.


Usage Scenario:

This form can be used in various applications such as user registration for e-commerce sites, online forums, and membership-based services. It ensures that all user-provided data is validated on the client side before being sent to the server, reducing the likelihood of errors and security issues.
