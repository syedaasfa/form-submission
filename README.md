Project Description:
The goal of this project is to design and implement a user-friendly registration form for a website. The form includes several fields that are essential for collecting user data, such as full name, email address, phone number, and password. It is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive layout and Font Awesome icons for an aesthetically pleasing appearance.

Features:
Responsive Design: Utilizes Bootstrap to ensure the form is accessible and looks good on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
Client-Side Validation: Incorporates JavaScript to validate user input before submission. This ensures that the data conforms to specified criteria, enhancing data integrity and user experience.
Security Features: Includes password and confirm password fields with conditions to enhance security, such as minimum character requirements and matching passwords.
Visual Feedback: Offers immediate, informative feedback if the user’s input does not meet the validation requirements. This feedback is shown right next to the respective input field in the form of an error message.
Interactive Elements: Features interactive icons and a toggle for showing or hiding passwords, improving user interaction and usability.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Structures the web form and defines its content.
CSS: Provides styling to make the form visually appealing. Custom styles are written to enhance Bootstrap’s default styles.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the form by handling client-side validation and the show/hide password functionality.
Bootstrap 4.5.2: Used for the responsive layout design and to incorporate responsive form controls.

Usage Scenario:
This form can be used in various applications such as user registration for e-commerce sites, online forums, and membership-based services. It ensures that all user-provided data is validated on the client side before being sent to the server, reducing the likelihood of errors and security issues.
